# Code Samples

## Project: Deadly Haunted Livestream
- This is an on-going project (Horror game) in Unity using c# and github. I mainly contribute as the AI programmmer but also assit on gameplay programming.
- Assembled a costumizable AI system that uses individual scripts for behaviors to easily switch and combine behaviors by adding those scripts to one or multiple AI agents.
- Created a sight detection system by filtering with layermasks and detecting colliders with raycasts.
- Developed a sound reporting system that is yet to be implemented in the game, but the logic has been constructed.
